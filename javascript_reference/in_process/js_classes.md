-----------------------------------------------------

JS classes are introduced in ECMAScript 6 and are syntactical sugar over JS's
existing prototype-based inheritance. The class syntax is **not** introducing
a new object-oriented inheritance model to JS. JS classes provide a much simpler
and clearer syntax to create objects and deal with Inheritance.

1. Defining classes.

	Classes are in fact "special factions", and just as you can define
	**function expression** and **function declarations**, the class syntax has 
	two components: **class expression** and **class declarations**

		* Class declarations

		One way to define a class is using a **class declaration**, to declare
		a class, you use use the class keyword with the name of the class
		("polygon" here.)

3. Sub classsing with extends




4. Species
