Controlling the for loop
========================

We can now control where the for loop starts and ends. What about controlling 
what happens in between?

The examples we've looked at have used i = i + 1. This has meant we have 
incremented (increased) the variable i by 1 each time.

Rules to learn

	* A more efficient way to code to increment up by 1 is to write i++.

	* We decrement down by 1 by writing i--.

	* We can increment up by any value by writing i += x, where x is how much we 
	want to increment up by. e.g., i += 3 counts up by 3s.

	* We can decrement down by any value by writing i -= x. (See the Hint for 
	more.)

	* Be very careful with your syntaxâ€”if you write a loop that can't properly 
	end, it's called an infinite loop. It will crash your browser!

Meet arrays
===========

Variables can store numbers or strings. But so far, we've only been able to 
store ONE number or ONE string. Good thing we have arrays. Arrays:

	* store lists of data

	* can store different data types at the same time

	* are ordered so the position of each piece of data is fixed

Conclusion
==========

	* if / else statements

	* functions

	* for loops

	* booleans, arrays, variables, etc.
