Mid-lesson breather
===================

Learned:

	* What while loops are

	* while loop syntax

	* How to avoid infinite loops

	* Next up, we'll cover the do/while loop, when to use while and when to use 
	for, and then put it all together in a loop-the-loop review.


`for loops` are great for doing the same task over and over when you know ahead 
of time how many times you'll have to repeat the loop. On the other hand. 
`while loops` are ideal when you have to loop, but you don't know ahead of time 
how many times you'll need to loop. You can combine a while loop with a counter 
variable to do the same kind of work a for loop does. In these cases, it's often 
a matter of preference.

Sometimes you want to make sure your loop runs at least one time no matter what. 
When this is the case, you want a modified while loop called a `do/while` loop.

Review
======

You've now learned about all the loops there are: for, while, and do.
